From Fuld Hall to Central Park
------------------------------


Along the canal until Main Street in South Bound Brook (35km)

We cross the canal on Main Street (300m) and we turn right after the canal.
We follow Lincoln Boulevard (3km) (it has a sidewalk)
We cross the rails at Mountain avenue (200m)
We go along South Avenue (densely populated, mostly with sidewalk, otherwise ~3 meters of grass on the side of the road) (3km)
We cross the rails at Madison Avenue (200m)
We go along North Avenue, which becomes W Front Street, then E Front Street (now we are in a city, large sidewalks on both sides) (6km)
We cross the rails at Richmond Street (500m)
We go along South Avenue (12.5km)
We take Aldene Road (300m)
We go along W 3rd Avenue, then Jersey Avenue (5.2km) (we could have stayed on South Avenue, which changes name and becomes W 1st Avenue and then W Grand St., but this other option is better in my opinion)
We turn right on Union Street (400m) just before the railway
We go along Westfield Avenue, then N Broad Street (for 1km, then slight right into) Newark Avenue, then Frelinghuysen Avenue (6.5km)
Turn right on Poiner Street (200m)
Turn left on Broad Street (2km)
Turn right on Market Street, then Ferry Street (4km)

At this point we have to cross a river, walking on a sidewalk on a bridge of the Lincoln Highway. I am 100% sure about the presence of the sidewalk on the bridge (in fact, this seems to be the only walkable bridge from Newark to Jersey City), but I cannot pinpoint the exact way to reach the sidewalk from Ferry street, we will figure it out there. In the path proposal there is a possible route, but it may be suboptimal. Going from Ferry Street (in Newark) to Communipaw Avenue (in Jersey City) should take 4km.

Walking to the Pier in Hoboken takes 8km. We are in a city, so many different routes are equivalent. Google maps selected one, but it is not important and I will not describe it here.

We take the ferry from Hoboken 14th Street to Midtown 39th Street (it takes 12 minutes, each 20 minutes, first one at 6:40, last one at 21:18)

Then, it's 3km to Central Park.
