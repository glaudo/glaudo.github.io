<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am postdoctoral member of the Institute for Advanced Study, in the school of mathematics.
I got my PhD under the supervision of Professor Alessio Figalli at ETH Zurich.</p>
<p>I am interested in the field of analysis in a rather broad sense: from differential geometry, to probability, going through partial differential equations.
I have worked on the random matching problem (a problem at the interface between optimal transport and probability), on the stability of functional/geometric inequalities,
on the properties of the free-boundary in the obstacle problem, and on the construction of the fundamental solution for an elliptic operator with analytic coefficients.
See my <a href="research.html">publications</a> for details on what I have worked on.</p>
<p>
I am currently investigating the stability of the fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality, 
the regularity of minimal surfaces at the boundary, 
and the determination of a set from the sums over all of its subsets.
</p>
<p>As a hobby, I enjoy organizing and taking part in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming">programming competitions</a> and
I have managed to take part in the finals of the most important contests all over the world (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_in_Informatics">IOI</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code_Jam">Google Code Jam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest">ICPC</a>).</p>
<p>I like to go running and I am a proud finisher of two half marathons.</p>
